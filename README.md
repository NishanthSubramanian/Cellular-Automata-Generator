# Cellular Automata Generator
## Synthesis of cellular automata from an irreducible polynomial

This is a python implementation of a method for the synthesis of a one-dimensional linear hybrid cellular automaton (CA) from
a given irreducible polynomial.

The folder **Galois_Field_mod_2** contains functions that such as mod 2 addition, multiiplication, division, etc
  
### How to run  
`python generate_linear_CA.py`
